write super.func() to call the function func(), it will call the method that was defined in the superclass.

Explanation:

        In this program, we create three classes one is the MethodOverriding which has the main method I also have one superclass which has the define_me method, and also I have one subclass which also has the same define_me method, and one constructor which calls the define_me method of superclass using super keyword.

        In the main method, we create one object of a subclass which automatically calls the constructor.

Example

Output: Hello I am a motorcycle, I am a cycle with an engine.

        My ancestor is a cycle who is a vehicle with pedals.


import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

class BiCycle{
    String define_me(){
        return "a vehicle with pedals.";
    }
}

class MotorCycle extends BiCycle{
    String define_me(){
        return "a cycle with an engine.";
    }

    MotorCycle(){
        System.out.println("Hello I am a motorcycle, I am "+ define_me());

        String temp=super.define_me();

        System.out.println("My ancestor is a cycle who is "+ temp );
    }

}
class MethodOverriding{
    public static void main(String []args){
        MotorCycle M =new MotorCycle();
    }
}
