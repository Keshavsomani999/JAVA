ðŸ“Œ Question :

The evil forest is guarded by vicious mandragoras. Garnet and her pet must make a journey through. She starts with 1 health point (s) and 0 experience points.

As she encounters each mandragora, her choices are:

1. Garnet's pet eats mandragora i. This increment s by 1 and defeats mandragora i.

2. Garnet's pet battles mandragora i. This increases p by s x H[I]  experience points and defeats mandragora i.

Once she defeats a mandragora, it is out of play. Given a list of mandragoras with various health levels, determine the maximum number of experience points she can collect on her journey.

ðŸ“Œ Explanation:

In this program, first I sort the list of health points and count the total health points. Then, I take three variables: the first is 'bestscore', initialized with 0, the second is 'eaten', initialized with 0, and the third is 's', initialized with the total health. After that, I take a while loop that runs until 's' is greater than 'bestscore'. In this loop, I first initialize 'bestscore' as 's' and then I subtract the 'eaten'th element of the 'nums' list from the total health. After that, I increment 'eaten' by 1 and then I calculate 1+ 'eaten' multiplied by the total health and assign it to 's'. At last, I print 'bestscore'.
