Question :

Amanda has a string of lowercase letters that she wants to copy to a new string. She can perform the following operations with the given costs. She can perform them any number of times to construct a new string P:
--Append a character to the end of string P at a cost of 1 dollar.
--Choose any substring of P and append it to the end of P at no charge.

Explanation:

In this program, First, we create two variables String p and int count. After that, I take one for loop which runs for every character of the string. in this for loop First I take one String variable ch and store the ith character in it. 

After that, we check if that character is present in the p String if it is not present then we increment the count variable and append this character to the and of the P String. At last, I return the count variable.

Test Cases :

1) if the String contains null characters.

Example:

Input:  2
        abcd
        abab

Output: 4
        2

public class StringConstruction {

    public static int stringConstruction(String s) {
        String p = "";
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            String ch = String.valueOf(s.charAt(i));
            if(!p.contains(ch)){
                count++;
                p+=s.charAt(i);
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

class StringConstruction_Exe {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(System.getenv("OUTPUT_PATH")));

        int q = Integer.parseInt(bufferedReader.readLine().trim());

        IntStream.range(0, q).forEach(qItr -> {
            try {
                String s = bufferedReader.readLine();

                int result = StringConstruction.stringConstruction(s);

                bufferedWriter.write(String.valueOf(result));
                bufferedWriter.newLine();
            } catch (IOException ex) {
                throw new RuntimeException(ex);
            }
        });

        bufferedReader.close();
        bufferedWriter.close();
    }
}
