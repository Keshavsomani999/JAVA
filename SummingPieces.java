ðŸ“Œ Question :

Consider an array, A, of length n. We can split A into contiguous segments called pieces and store them as another array, B. We consider the value of a piece in some array B to be (Sum of all numbers in the piece) x (length of the piece), and we consider the total value of some array B to be the sum of the values for all pieces in that B. Given A, find the total values for all possible 's, sum them together, and print this sum modulo (10^9 +7) on a new line.

ðŸ“Œ Explanation:

In this program, First I have to find all possible pairs of sub-array from the given array, and then I have to calculate the sum of that array multiplied by the size of that array. for that I take one for loop In this loop first I calculate left then right. After that, I add both left and right and minus the n-1th element of the powers array. After that, I apply mod and store it to sum variable. At last print the sum variable.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
ðŸ“Œ Input:

3
1 3 6

ðŸ“Œ Output:
73

            powers2[i] = (powers2[i - 1] << 1) % 1000000007;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            long left = ((powers2[i] - 1) * powers2[n - i]) % 1000000007;
            long right = ((powers2[1 + n - i] - 1) * powers2[i - 1]) % 1000000007;
            long v = left + right - powers2[n - 1];
            sum = (sum + (v * in.nextLong())) % 1000000007;
